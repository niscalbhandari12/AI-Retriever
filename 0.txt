At first, the input sequence is broken down into a series of tokens or individual sequence components. For instance, if the input is a sentence, the tokens are words. Embedding then transforms the token sequence into a mathematical vector sequence. The vectors carry semantic and syntax information, represented as numbers, and their attributes are learned during the training process./ppYou can visualize vectors as a series of coordinates in an ndimensional space. As a simple example, think of a twodimensional graph, where x represents the alphanumeric value of the first letter of the word and y represents their categories. The word banana has the value 2,2 because it starts with the letter b and is in the category fruit. The word mango has the value 13,2 because it starts with the,

The transformer needs a way to consider the order of the tokens in the input sequence. Positional encoding adds information to each tokens embedding to indicate its position in the sequence. This is often done by using a set of functions that generate a unique positional signal that is added to the embedding of each token. With positional encoding, the model can preserve the order of the tokens and understand the sequence context./ppPositional en,
